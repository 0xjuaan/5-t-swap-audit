# TSwap 

This project is meant to be a permissionless way for users to swap assets between each other at a fair price. You can think of T-Swap as a decentralized asset/token exchange (DEX). 

T-Swap is known as an [Automated Market Maker (AMM)](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm) because it doesn't use a normal "order book" style exchange, instead it uses "Pools" of an asset.
